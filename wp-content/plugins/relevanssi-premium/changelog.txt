* Direct attachment links in search results work better now, especially in cases where the site has moved.
* Improved handling of certain edge cases in taxonomy search.
* Home page links were getting the highlight parameter even though they shouldn't. This has been fixed.

* The status of the 'Index PDF contents for parent post' option didn't show up correctly on the settings page.
* Added support for WP JV Post Reading Groups.
* Improved handling of HTML entities.
* Events Made Easy Calendar shortcodes are now removed when building excerpts.
* `set_time_limit()` was removed from the indexing; it's no longer necessary, and it can break the indexing on sites that don't allow the use of the function.
* `relevanssi_post_title_before_tokenize` filter was moved a bit so that it's the last thing that runs before tokenizing.
* When indexing custom MySQL column data, stopwords and minimum word length weren't applied properly.
* Disabled shortcodes are handled better in the indexing: the shortcode names won't be indexed anymore like they were before.
* Fix for pinning in multisite context.
* Made sure there won't be a warning for non-numeric values when searching.
* Removed unnecessary post types from the weight setting list.
* New filter: `relevanssi_clean_excerpt` lets you remove unwanted highlights from excerpts.
* Highlighting works better with `pre` and `code` tags.
* New filter: `relevanssi_comment_author_to_index` lets you filter comment author names before indexing.
* `relevanssi_comment_content_to_index` doesn't include the comment author name anymore.

= 2.1.6.1 =
* The privacy features caused an error notice with certain Relevanssi configurations, and the plugin required WP 4.9.6.

= 2.1.6 =
* Privacy: If you log search queries, Relevanssi will suggest some additional content to your privacy policy page.
* Privacy: Relevanssi now supports the new Privacy Policy and Personal Data tools in WordPress 4.9.6.
* Improved Polylang support. Now taxonomy terms can be language filtered as well.
* Saving synonyms with quotes worked, but the synonyms showed up wrong.
* Taxonomy term indexing had a bug where the `type` column for taxonomy terms would be set to 0.
* The `relevanssi_user_index_ok` filter is now applied when users are updated.
* Relevanssi could in some situations override navigation menu links with links to the user profiles or taxonomy terms found in the search. This update fixes that behaviour.
* Random order works again; using orderby `rand` didn't work properly. The `rand(seed)` format is also supported now.
* Fixed quotes and apostrophes in Did you mean suggestions.

= 2.1.5 =
* New feature: WooCommerce product visibility can now be considered better in the indexing. See the filter hook 'relevanssi_woocommerce_indexing' for more details.
* Phrases were not highlighted correctly on documents. This is now fixed.
* Shortcode fix: 'wp_show_posts' shouldn't cause problems anymore.
* Fix for post tag indexing issues.
* MemberPress post controls were loose and showed drafts to searchers. That is now fixed.
* Highlighting was too loose, even if matching was set to whole words.
* Highlighting now works better in cases where there's a hyphen or an apostrophe inside a word.

= 2.1.4 =
* Fixed cases where Relevanssi added an ellipsis even if the excerpt was from the start of the post.
* Highlighting now works with numeric search strings.
* Improved highlighting for accented words. Thanks to Paul Ryan.
* A surplus comma at the end of post exclusion setting won't break the search anymore.

* New "Pin this post for all keywords" feature.

= 2.1.3 =
* Recent post bonus is now applied to searches.
* Exact term setting can now be disabled.
* Users of Members plugin would have drafts appear in search results. This is now fixed.

* "Index unindexed posts" works better.
* Removing quotes and apostrophes in indexing didn't work properly.
* Attachment indexing progress meter fixed.
* The "Highlight from external searches" option was removed. It's not supported by Google or Bing anymore, so there's little point in keeping it.

= 2.1.2 =
* MemberPress post control was backwards.
* Fusion Builder shortcodes are automatically removed from excerpts.
* Indexing failed, when a same word appeared in two different taxonomies.
* Internal link management had a bit of a bug in the indexing.
* User searches page reset buttons fixed.

= 2.1.1.1 =
* Fixes an issue where you can't save taxonomy indexing settings.

= 2.1.1 =
* Automated testing can't catch everything... There was some overzealous security in place, breaking Network options. That is now fixed.
* Attachment file name is not prepended to the excerpts automatically.

= 2.1 =
* Relevanssi code has been reviewed and modified to follow WordPress coding standards. As a result, there have been minor improvements all around the code to make things more robust and secure.
* Attachment indexing has been extended to many more document types: now it should be able to handle most document types, including Office and OpenDocument formats. It's also slightly faster.
* There's now an option to do attachment reading in an EU-based server.
* Custom field detail is no longer serialized. It's now JSON. If you use custom field detail, rebuild the index and change your code to use json_decode() instead of unserialize().
* `relevanssi_the_tags()` and `relevanssi_get_the_tags()` now have different set of parameters, more in line with `the_tags()` and `get_the_tags()`.
* Taxonomy indexing settings were emptied out if you saved another options tab. That is now fixed.
* Improvements to WPML support; WPML is now less likely to be confused in multisite searches.
* Updated filter: `relevanssi_search_ok` now gets the WP_Query object as a parameter, which is helpful if you're not using the global $wp_query.
* ACF Flexible Content field indexing didn't work properly, possibly due to a change in ACF. That should now work better.

= 2.0.5 =
* Fixed a bug in "Did you mean" suggestions.
* Paid Member Subscription shortcode compatibility.
* Indexing works better when there are plenty of excluded posts.
* Ampersand handling works better in titles.
* Relevanssi won't add the `highlight` parameter to links pointing to the front page anymore (because that makes those links point to the blog page).
* There's less need for `relevanssi_get_permalink()` now, as Relevanssi can adjust the links printed out with `get_permalink()`.
* The [searchform] shortcode can now take parameters, for example: `[searchform post_types="page"]` will print out a search form that only searches pages.
* Small improvement for excerpt-building, thanks to ___ _______.

= 2.0.4 =
* Fixed filter: `relevanssi_custom_field_value` didn't get the post ID correctly.
* Relevanssi used `sanitize_hex_color`, which isn't actually reliably available.
* Multisite searches didn't support `orderby` and `order` parameters.
* Did you mean suggestions have been improved.
* New filter: `relevanssi_do_not_index_term` lets you control whether or not taxonomy terms are indexed.
* Single-word phrases are not allowed anymore, as they do no good. They are silently converted to non-phrases now.
* `relevanssi_get_permalink` doesn't add the `highlight` parameter to URLs outside search results pages anymore.
* Setting post type or post content weight to 0 didn't work.
* Search form shortcode echoed out the search form, instead of returning it as it should.
* Gravity Forms shortcode is now disabled in Relevanssi indexing.
* ACF repeater field indexing doesn't break if you try to index multilevel repeaters (that still won't work, but it won't break everything either).
* HTML tags are stripped from post excerpts when using the excerpt to build Relevanssi excerpts.
* User indexing is now done in steps, after it turned out to be impossible to index 16,000 users at once.
* New filter: `relevanssi_excerpt_query` filters the search query before building excerpts.
* New option: if you choose to hide Relevanssi from post edit pages, you can allow admins to see the Relevanssi post controls.

= 2.0.3.1 =
* There was a small error in the multisite installation procedure, now fixed.

= 2.0.3 =
* Uninstalling Relevanssi was broken. That is now fixed.
* In some cases excerpt-building could take ages because of autoembed link discovery. Relevanssi now blocks the autoembed procedure in link-building.
* © and ® symbols caused problems in indexing; they are now included in the default punctuation removal.
* Fixed filter: `relevanssi_pdf_read_timeout` wasn't applied to all cases of timeouts.
* Updated filter: `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` now gets a second parameter that contains the post ID.
* New filter: `relevanssi_custom_field_value` is used to filter custom field values both before indexing and before excerpt-building. Parameters include the field name and the post ID.
* Indexing PDF content didn't work properly if Relevanssi was set to index visible custom fields.
* There was a bug in importing the options.
* New setting can be enabled to read in the contents of new PDF files as they are uploaded on the site. This is disabled by default.

= 2.0.2 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_multisite_public_status` lets you make non-public multisite subsites available in the search.
* New filter: `relevanssi_pdf_read_timeout` lets you increase the PDF reading timeout from the default value of 45 seconds.
* Deprecated filter: `relevanssi_index_taxonomies_args` is no longer used, because Relevanssi doesn't use `get_terms()` anymore in taxonomy term indexing.
* New filter: `relevanssi_hide_empty_terms` can be used instead of `relevanssi_index_taxonomies_args` to include empty taxonomy terms in indexing. Defaults to `true`, set to `false` to include taxonomy terms that are not attached to any posts.
* Taxonomy term indexing is now done in small steps to prevent timeout issues when indexing large numbers of taxonomy terms.
* Improvements to the Polylang setting.
* PDFs were always indexed for the parent post, never mind the value of the option.

= 2.0.1 =
* Fixes a fatal error that happened with older PHP versions.

= 2.0 =
* Legacy code has been removed. If you have a version older than 1.16, update first to 1.16.x to guarantee smooth upgrade process.
* This version includes a small database change, so if you're updating from a previous version, after the update deactivate the plugin and then reactivate.
* Improved indexing: no more clicking "Continue indexing" again and again!
* Settings pages have been completely rewritten.
* There's documentation in the WordPress contextual help: just click Help on the top right corner.
* Better Polylang support. A new option to remove the Polylang language filter.
* Logs can be automatically trimmed. Old log entries are removed to save space.
* Finally a setting to adjust content weight!
* Excerpts can use the custom field content.
* Highlighting in documents is changed: it now requires a `highlight` query parameter. This helps getting pass caching and makes the highlighting more reliable. To get the query parameter active, use `relevanssi_get_permalink()` to print out the permalinks on the search results templates.
* Relevanssi added synonyms to highlighting even if synonyms were not used for searching. In some cases, synonyms were added twice.
* The User Searches page got a makeover, too.
* Relevanssi is automatically disabled in REST API searches.
* Groups and Simple Membership support has been improved.
* Sorting search results is now up to 300 times faster than before.
* Lots of improvements all over the place.
* New filter: `relevanssi_excerpt_custom_field_content` lets you modify custom field content that is used for excerpts.
* New filter: `relevanssi_punctuation_filter` allows for easy modification of punctuation handling.
* New filter: `relevanssi_default_punctuation_replacement` changes the default way to handle the rest of the punctuation.
* New filter: `relevanssi_search_again` lets you run the search again if no results are found and to modify the parameters between search runs.

* New filter: `relevanssi_page_builder_shortcodes` lets you control which page builder shortcodes Relevanssi removes before building the excerpts.
* New filter: `relevanssi_optimize_excerpts` makes excerpt-building faster, if you make the filter return `true`.
* New query variable: set `include_attachments` to `0`, `off` or `false` to exclude attachments from the search.

= 1.16.2.1 =
* Fixing a bug in the sorting algorithm.

= 1.16.2 =
* ACF repeater fields with dashes didn't work; that is now fixed.
* Simple Membership plugin is now supported automatically to restrict access to posts.
* Relevanssi can now handle orderby parameter in array format.
* Relevanssi now blocks Easy Digital Downloads shortcodes when indexing to improve compatibility with EDD.
* When using `fields` to only fetch post IDs, Relevanssi doesn't try to highlight post titles.
* New action: `relevanssi_update_options` lets you adjust Relevanssi options immediately after the defaults are set.
* Remove notices about duplicated database columns when installing the plugin.

= 1.16.1 =
* SECURITY: This version fixes a SQL injection vulnerability, where a site admin could theoretically inject SQL code into Relevanssi search queries. Doing this required access to Relevanssi settings page and in my tests, I couldn't do any damage, just break the Relevanssi search, but in any case, this vulnerability is now fixed.
* Multisite meta queries didn't work properly.
* Search and Filter shortcode is added to the blacklist.
* Groups plugin is now supported automatically to restrict access to posts.
* The filter `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` now works even if the custom field setting is empty.
* The filter `relevanssi_tax_term_additional_content` now works even when the taxonomy description is empty.
* Relevanssi taxonomy term indexing is moved to a later priority (from 10 to 9999) to make sure all term data is available for indexing.
* The filter `relevanssi_post_to_index` now has a second parameter. For posts, it simply repeats the post object, but for taxonomy terms, it has the term object.

= 1.16.0.1 =
* Fixes "unknown column" issues in multisite searches.
* Removes errors when trying to search a multisite subsite that doesn't have Relevanssi.
* Small fix to make automatic updates work better in a multisite environment.

= 1.16.0 =
* Changed a bit how Relevanssi attaches itself to queries. Instead of the global $wp_query, Relevanssi now uses the query passed as the parameter to `the_posts` filter hook. This should improve compatibility in some cases, but may cause problems in some fringe cases. If you're doing something unusual with Relevanssi, try this out before deploying to public use.
* Internal link processing had some minor issues, which are now straightened out.
* Some meta queries caused major problems with the Relevanssi weighting algorithm. This has now been fixed.
* Error notices caused by trying to use a non-existing taxonomy term have been removed.

= 1.15.4 =
* Improved performance of multisite queries.
* Copying settings between multisite sites didn't work in networks of over 100 sites. Now the limit is 2000.
* Post type exclusion didn't work as expected.
* Relevanssi couldn't handle nested tax queries (such as those generated by WooCommerce product visibility filtering) properly.
* Fake posts created for taxonomy terms now include the parent in $post->post_parent.
* Doing a quick edit cleaned out the Relevanssi post controls settings.

= 1.15.3.1 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_allow_one_letter_highlights` lets you allow one-letter highlights. Just make the filter function return `true`.
* New filter: `relevanssi_block_one_letter_searches` by default blocks one-letter searches. If you want to enable them, add a filter function that always returns `false`.
* Fixed an undefined variable notice.

= 1.15.3 =
* Multisite search won't attempt to search in blogs that don't exist or are deleted or marked spam.
* Synonym indexing failed if synonyms contained a forward slash.
* Highlighting HTML tags has been improved further.
* New filter: `relevanssi_tag_before_tokenize` allows you to access tag content before indexing.
* Improvements to taxonomy terms and post type parameters. Now if you set a post type parameter, taxonomy terms or user profiles are not included in the search. In order to see taxonomy terms in the search results when using `post_types` parameter, add the taxonomy name (or `user`) to the `post_types` parameter. This does not work with the default `post_type` parameter.
* Relevanssi now actively blocks one-letter search terms, as they are generally pointless and can cause "out of memory" issues. One-letter search terms are no longer highlighted, either. These are usually caused by cases like "word's" being interpreted as "word s".
* New filter: `relevanssi_disable_shortcodes_excerpt` lets you add more shortcodes to be disabled before excerpts are built.
* Relevanssi now indexes taxonomy terms whenever they are created.
* Relevanssi now supports `fieldname_%_subfieldname` notation for ACF repeater fields in "Custom fields to index" settings.

= 1.15.2.1 =
* An extra parentheses killed the WP CLI indexing.

= 1.15.2 =
* When a taxonomy term was saved, Relevanssi didn't record the changes correctly.
* New WP CLI commands to index only users or taxonomies.
* Improved the way highlighting handles HTML tags, especially when highlighting on post pages.
* Relevanssi didn't remove taxonomy term data from the index properly. I recommend rebuilding the taxonomy terms (which you can do easily with the new WP CLI command `wp relevanssi index --target=taxonomies`).
* The throttle limit setting was removed from the settings page for causing trouble. If you need to change it, update `relevanssi_throttle_limit` option directly.
* The "Did you mean" function should return slightly more relevant results.
* The `relevanssi_get_words_query` filter hook has been retired and replaced with new `relevanssi_get_words_having` filter hook, used to adjust the value. The default value is 1, and there's usually no reason to adjust that.
* FacetWP users ran into trouble, as `relevanssi_do_query()` started to explicitly expect a WP_Query object in version 1.15.0. That expectation is removed; it's still highly recommended for future compatibility that you use WP_Query objects.
* Small bug fix: `get_current_screen()` is now only used when it's available to avoid occasional fatal errors.
* Error messages from `DOING_AJAX` being undefined should be removed.

= 1.15.1 =
* Enabling "Index synonyms" setting with an empty synonym list caused post content and title indexing to fail.
* Wrong pages creeping into navigation menus from multisite searches should be history now.
* Relevanssi Premium now offers WP CLI support. See `wp help relevanssi` for instructions.
* Relevanssi didn't support tax_queries with `field` set to `name`. That works now.
* Much faster way of showing the 25 most common words in the index. If you've disabled this feature because it was so slow, try enabling it - you might be surprised!

= 1.15.0.1 =
* The network settings page was missing.

= 1.15.0 =
* Improved ACF compatibility.
* Relevanssi was a bit too eager to index taxonomy terms it shouldn't. That is now fixed. I suggest you rebuild the index, if you haven't done that recently.
* Synonym indexing was searching and replacing too much. If you're using synonym indexing, please rebuild the index.
* It is now possible to copy Relevanssi settings from one blog in the multisite network to all other blogs.
* On multisite installations, the API key is now a network option. The network admin needs to set the value from the network admin dashboard.
* Relevanssi post controls didn't work on attachments: you couldn't save the values. That is now possible.
* Pinning didn't work on multisite searches. It does now.
* Relevanssi now stores the operator used in $wp_query->query_vars['operator'] so that it can be accessed outside Relevanssi.

= 1.14.9 =
* Did you mean function had a XSS vulnerability, which is now removed.
* Minimum word length wasn't applied to titles in indexing. It is now fixed. If you think this is a problem, rebuild the index.
* TablePress compatibility has been improved.
* Meta query handling has been improved, thanks to Maxime Culea.
* Improved WP_Query parameter support: setting query variable `sentence` to 1 forces phrase search.

= 1.14.8 =
* An improved version of the sorting function will not throw notices when Intuitive Custom Post Order plugin is used.
* New filter: `relevanssi_missing_sort_key` can be used to adjust the result sorting when using keys that are not present in all posts (eg. menu_order).
* Importing options now works, it was broken in 1.14.6.
* New feature: keyword-based exclusion is the opposite of the pinning feature. You can now list keywords on post edit screen, and if the search query matches those keywords, the post will not appear in results.
* Czech translation and stopwords, thanks to Michael Kucera.

= 1.14.7.1 =
* Relevanssi threw a fatal error with PHP 7.1 thanks to a wrong variable declaration.
* The accidental PHP 5.4+ requirement has been removed.

= 1.14.7 =
* Relevanssi broke the WP admin menu search when admin searches were enabled.
* Pinning now supports multi-word search terms.
* Relevanssi broke the admin page search under WP 4.7. Relevanssi is now disabled in admin page searches.
* The way accented characters are handled in highlighting is improved. A new filter, `relevanssi_accents_replacement_arrays`, can be used to adjust the accent replacement.

= 1.14.6.1 =
* Fix for a fatal bug in 1.14.6.

= 1.14.6 =
* Relevanssi option import had a arbitrary code execution vulnerability that is now blocked.
* Relevanssi admin page had a vulnerability that allowed SQL injection attacks. That is now fixed.
* Relevanssi didn't like to highlight search terms that are followed by a ?, an ! or an apostrophe.
* New filter: `relevanssi_ok_to_log` lets you control whether search queries are logged or not.

= 1.14.5 =
* Relevanssi had problems with plus signs in search queries.
* 500 errors caused by arrays in custom fields should be gone now.
* Post type filters in multisite searching work better now, and meta_query support is now added. (Thanks to Maxime Culea.)
* Improvements to the ACF "select" field support.
* Relevanssi will not break when frontend plugins insert posts.
* Polylang support has been improved.
* WPML and Polylang filters work when "fields" is set to "ids".
* `relevanssi_match` filter has a new parameter, which contains the search term.
* `relevanssi_post_ok` filter was missing from the multisite search.

= 1.14.4 =
* Fixed a small glitch that could happen if a highlighted term is next to a starting square bracket.
* Bug fixes in the multisite searching: post type weights work now, and relevancy scores are properly noted.
* Ensured PHP7 and WP 4.6 compatibility.
* New filter: `relevanssi_30days` can be used to adjust the 30 day logs to a different number of days.

= 1.14.3 =
* Fix for a small bug that caused inflated relevancy values.
* `relevanssi_didyoumean_url` has two more parameters (uncorrected query and the suggestion).
* The Did you mean function didn't work properly if the search term wasn't in lowercase.
* Adding stopwords that contain apostrophes didn't work.
* Relevanssi can now index the human-readable labels of ACF "select" fields. (Thanks to Raphaël Droz.)

= 1.14.2 =
* Fixed a fatal error when searching includes private posts.

= 1.14.1 =
* Multisite searches had some compatibility issues with other plugins and navigation menus; those have now been fixed.
* Multisite search (which has limitations) doesn't trigger if the search only targets the current site.
* Multisite search can now return taxonomy terms.
* "Did you mean" corrections in search queries with many words work better now.
* Fixed an error if the search term was not found in content.
* Fixed an error when building excerpts from posts shorter than the excerpt length.
* Blocked the `[starpro]`, CFDB and WooCommerce shortcodes that are causing problems with Relevanssi.
* Added support for `term_tax_id` in the `fields` parameter in tax_queries.
* Excerpt-building failed if multibyte string operations were missing. It should work now.
* New filter: `relevanssi_remove_stopwords_in_titles` allows you to include stopwords in titles.
* New filter: `relevanssi_remote_addr` can be used to modify the IP address logged to Relevanssi logs.
* New filter: `relevanssi_user_searches_limit` to adjust the number of user searches shown in the logs.
* Old data check is only done on Relevanssi settings page, not on all admin pages. That should improve admin performance.

= 1.14 =
* Tokenizer was using `strlen()` and not `mb_strlen()`, so word lengths were not calculated properly. If your site uses non-ASCII alphabet, rebuilding the index is a good idea.
* Printing out titles for taxonomy terms didn't work properly. `relevanssi_the_title()` works for that and if you don't want to echo the title, you can use it like `relevanssi_the_title(false)` to make it return the title.
* Small improvement to WPML multilanguage filtering.
* `relevanssi_user_add_data` only worked when indexing all users.
* "Undefined index" errors in multisite search were eliminated.
* The `[noindex]` shortcode now supports shortcodes inside it.
* When posts transitioned from "future" to "published" there were some issues with disappearing Relevanssi settings. That's fixed now.
* The `[watupro]` shortcode didn't work with Relevanssi, so Relevanssi will now bypass it.
* Relevanssi had `the_title` filter hook calls that were missing the second parameter; that's now fixed.
* The excerpt-building algorithm is completely rewritten based on work by Ben Boyter (http://www.boyter.org/).
* The plugin i18n features have been improved slightly.
* New filter: `relevanssi_didyoumean_suggestion` lets you modify the Did you mean? suggestion before it's displayed.
* `relevanssi_didyoumean()` has a new parameter: you can now choose whether the result is echoed out (the default value) or just returned.
* Multisite search had some problems with some Relevanssi variables not changing when the blog was switched. This is now improved, thanks to Teemu Muikku.
* In the search results breakdown, you can now use %categories% and %taxonomies% to show the number of matches in categories and taxonomies other than tags and cats, respectively.
* Search results breakdowns now work for taxonomy terms and user profiles.
* Relevanssi supports `fields` parameter (both `ids` and `id=>parent`) to return only post IDs or post IDs and post parents.

= 1.13.5 =
* Previous version broke the multisite search. That is now fixed.
* Empty lines on synonym settings caused problems. Fixed that.
* Relevanssi didn't clean up properly on uninstall, leaving _relevanssi_pin postmeta fields.

= 1.13.4 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_valid_admin_status` can be used to adjust post statuses that Relevanssi will handle.
* Meta query support should now be perfect; there were some limitations with complicated meta queries before.

= 1.13.3 =
* Removes one "Undefined variable" error.
* New filter: `relevanssi_display_common_words` can be used to disable the "25 most common words" listing on the settings page, if it's too heavy to load.
* Eliminated problems where using the `relevanssi_do_not_index` filter caused error messages.
* Relevanssi was sanitizing taxonomy titles too aggressively. That is now toned down a bit.
* If Relevanssi creates an empty excerpt for a post and there's a user-set excerpt for the post, that excerpt is used.
* The `relevanssi_post_title_before_tokenize` filter now has a second parameter that contains the post object.
* No ellipsis is added to the post excerpt, if the post excerpt shows the whole post.
* Relevanssi now supports `post_parent`, `post_parent__in` and `post_parent__not_in`, though you have to set them in `relevanssi_modify_wp_query` filter for them to work.

= 1.13.2 =
* Fixed a bug that caused the results to change depending of the order of words in a multi-word search query.
* Added `product_categories` and `recent_products` from WooCommerce to the list of blocked shortcodes.
* There are improvements in excerpt-building and highlighting, especially when fuzzy search is enabled.
* Fixed a possible (if quite unlikely) XSS vulnerability.
* Improved search performance (thanks to MikeNGarrett).
* Sometimes highlights in documents make the document content disappear. I don't know why, but I've added a fix that should make the content visible (without the highlights) if a problem appears.

= 1.13.1 =
* Fixed a bug with numeric taxonomy terms.
* Fixed a bug in user search.
* API keys are now completely hidden on the Relevanssi settings page.
* `relevanssi_do_not_index` hook is moved a bit, so that when updating posts, posts that are not indexed because of the hook are now removed from the index.
* Pinning didn't work if the post wasn't otherwise found with the pinning term. Now pinning terms are also indexed to ensure that the posts can be found with them.

= 1.13 =
* New feature: You can now pin posts on particular search terms.
* New feature: Synonyms can now be defined in indexing, allowing them to be used with AND searches. (Thanks to Christoph Daum.)
* Relevanssi handles taxonomy terms in search better. The change requires a reindexing.
* Fix in indexing: Relevanssi will now bypass the global $post when indexing. This should help with problems with the Cookie Law Info plugin, for example.
* Tax query relation setting didn't work properly. It is now fixed.
* Word-based excerpt building sometimes created too short excerpts. That is now fixed.
* Synonyms are now highlighted.
* Phrase matching had issues where searching for a too common phrase crashed the search. That has been fixed.
* LIKE operator didn't work properly in meta_queries.
* API key field in settings is now a password field so clients and users can't see the API key.
* Relevanssi created lots of unnecessary post_meta rows and didn't clean up properly afterwards. Now unnecessary rows are not created, and everything is cleaned up properly.
* Problems with Avatar Upload plugin are fixed.
* Offset errors with mb_stripos() shouldn't happen anymore.
* Relevanssi tables are now added to `wpmu_drop_tables` to ensure neat cleanup with WPMU.
* A small problem in taxonomy search MySQL fixed, also a small problem with AND operator in tax_queries.
* Did you mean function now handles umlauted alphabet (ä, ö, ü and å).
* Fixed a bug with WP_Date_Queries. Thanks to Charles St-Pierre.

* New filter: `relevanssi_private_cap` lets you set the correct capability for finding private posts in custom post types.
* The option to exclude categories and tags from search only worked for categories, not tags. Tags have been separated to a different option.

= 1.12 =
* Relevanssi now automatically treats 'ß' as 'ss'. If your site has 'ß' in text, reindexing the database is a good idea.
* Query variable `post_status` is now supported.
* Improvements to excerpts: excerpts with phrases work much better now, and the excerpt creation logic has been improved: the excerpts are now better. The process takes a bit more time, though.
* Allowing HTML tags in excerpts could lead to those tags being left open. Relevanssi will now try to close open HTML tags in excerpts.

* The old title highlighting method has been disabled, because it caused highlights in wrong places. Now the highlighted title is stored in $post->highlighted_post_title, take it from there or use the Relevanssi title functions to display it.
* Polylang and WPML support was adjusted to perform better in edge cases.
* Indexing is faster, thanks to some improved code from Tom Novelli.
* MySQL injection attack vulnerability removed.
* The cache feature is now removed. Relevanssi should automatically drop the cache tables.

* Fix for a bug that sometimes caused multisite hits to come from the wrong site.

= 1.11 =

* Fixed a problem with an author dropdown with no author selected.

= 1.10.13 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_comment_content_to_index` lets you modify comment content before it's indexed by Relevanssi (to index comment meta, for example).

* Numerical search terms work better now.
* Relevanssi now handles WordPress-created tax_queries better.
* Support for Polylang broke the support for WPML. That is now fixed.

* Relevanssi won't break BBPress search anymore.
* Multisite searches had some issues.

= 1.10.12 =
* Excerpt-building had issues, which are now fixed.
* Punctuation removal now replaces &nbsp; with a space.
* "starrater" short code from GD Star Rating is now disabled in indexing.
* Punctuation removal now replaces invisible spaces with a normal space.

* Relevanssi doesn't apply `get_the_excerpt` filters to excerpts it builds any more.
* New filter: `relevanssi_excerpt` lets you modify the excerpts Relevanssi creates.
* Relevanssi now suspends WP post cache while indexing, making indexing a lot more efficient. Thanks to Julien Mession for this one.
* Deprecated function errors in 3.6 removed.
* When search included user profiles or taxonomy terms, Relevanssi would generate lots of MySQL errors. Not anymore.
* New filter: `relevanssi_valid_status` lets you modify the post statuses Relevanssi indexes.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_taxonomies_args` lets you modify the arguments passed to get_terms() when indexing taxonomies (for example to set 'hide_empty' to false).
* Searching by taxonomy ID could confuse two taxonomies with the same term_id. The search is now checking the taxonomy as well to see it's correct.
* Basic support for Polylang plugin.
* Russian and Italian stopwords are now included, thanks to Flector and Valerio Vendrame.
* Small fix in the way user meta fields are handled.

= 1.10.11 =
* Previous upgrade broke AND operator in searches. Fixed that.

= 1.10.10 =
* REBUILD THE INDEX AFTER THIS UPDATE.
* Prevented error messages relating to creation of post objects from users and taxonomies.
* Fixed MySQL errors from empty meta queries.
* Removed WP complaint about badly formed $wpdb->prepare() statement.

= 1.10.9.1 =
* OR fallback didn't actually fall back to OR, but instead got stuck in an endless loop of AND searches.
* Relevanssi was being called twice when a post was saved, on `save_post` and `wp_insert_post`. I removed the hook on `save_post`.

= 1.10.9 =
* Fixed the auto-update problem in 1.10.8 asking to update after update was done.
* Meta queries didn't work without a key; now they work with just meta_value or meta_value_num.
* Modified the way the highlights work; now highlighting words with apostrophes should produce more meaningful results.

= 1.10.8 =
* Major indexing problems caused by shortcodes changing the post ID during the indexing of posts are now fixed.
* Meta queries had problems with meta_value being set to null.
* Relevanssi now supports category__and. By default this sets include_children to false.

* Author search didn't work.
* Fixed an error message caused by all-number synonyms starting with zero, like 02.
* New action hook: `relevanssi_pre_indexing_query` can be used to "SET OPTION SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1" if needed.
* Synonyms are now case-insensitive.
* Highlighting should not highlight anything between & and ; or in <style> or <script> tags, thus solving some of the problems related to highlights. Reports of how well this works are welcome.
* On-post highlighting now only highlights content in the loop, so menu texts and other off-the-loop stuff should not get highlights anymore.
* Multiple taxonomy term search broke when there were empty entries in the search. Fixed that.
* New filter: `relevanssi_default_tax_query_relation` can be used to change the default tax query relation from OR to AND.
* New filter: `relevanssi_bots_to_not_log` makes it possible to block bots from logs. The format matches what other plugins, ie. WP-Useronline, use for bot blocking, so you can share block lists.
* New filter: `relevanssi_admin_search_ok` gives you more control when Relevanssi overrides the default WP search in admin, useful for fixing P2P_Box AJAX search.
* New filter: `relevanssi_term_add_data` lets you add data to taxonomy terms before they are indexed.
* Fixed undefined variable errors when doing an OR fallback.

* Unsuccessful searches are now ordered by count, like the successful queries are.

= 1.10.7 =
* Removes the nasty error message on Relevanssi settings page when nothing was checked for "Choose taxonomies to index". I also added some additional instruction about the two very similar taxonomy indexing features.
* Fixed some problems with Did you mean? feature: number searches work better and exact matches don't cause the basic version of the feature to activate any more.
* Fixed a bug that could cause an error message about array_unique() function.
* $match->tag now contains the number of tag hits.

= 1.10.6 =
* Tags in breakdowns always showed 0, even though tags were indexed and searched correctly. That's now fixed.

* Fixed a bug in indexing user profiles and taxonomy terms.
* Fixed the problems with Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven themes better.
* Relevanssi now adds relevance score to posts before passing them to relevanssi_hits_filter. You can find it in $post->relevance_score.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_comments_exclude` can be used to exclude comments from indexing. The filter gets the post ID as a parameter, so you can prevent comments of particular posts being indexed, yet index those posts.
* You can now choose the taxonomies to index from a checkbox list.
* New Premium feature: you can disable particular shortcodes from the shortcode expansion.

= 1.10.4 =
* AND search did not work in all cases.
* Posts couldn't be found by category name. Fixed that.

= 1.10.3 =
* Exclude category option was broken. Fixed that.
* Searching for a non-existing category ID caused an error. Fixed that.
* Occasional blank screens of death occurred when multibyte string operations weren't installed. That should not happen anymore.
* Fallback to OR search was a bit broken.
* New users are automatically indexed, that didn't work before.

= 1.10.2 =
* Small fix to prevent database errors.

* Fixes a problem with Twenty Ten and Twenty Eleven themes that caused doubled "Continue Reading" links.
* Small touches here and there.

= 1.10 =
* Made some changes to how user profiles and taxonomy terms are handled. As a result, there should be less warning notices. For user profiles, you can now find the user id in $post->user_id and for taxonomies, the term id is $post->term_id.
* Deleting users and taxonomy terms caused problems. Fixed that.
* Fixed a notice about undefined variable on plugin update pages.
* Small bug fixes on search to remove warning notices.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` can be used to modify the list of custom fields to index.
* Deleting menus caused a warning. That is now fixed.
* Relevanssi has an option to disable IP logging (which is actually illegal in some countries). Thanks to Stefan Eufinger.
* Searching in subcategories worked sometimes, but not always. Thanks to Faebu.
* The "Limit searches" option didn't work too well in the case of strong weightings, as it didn't take note of any weights. Now it works better.
* Added a note about disabling custom excerpts when they are not needed - they can slow down the search quite a bit.
* New filter: `relevanssi_options_capability` can be used to modify the capability required to see the options page (default is `manage_options`).
* External search highlighting from Google doesn't work anymore, because Google doesn't pass the search term in referrer fields. Fixed the highlighting for Yahoo searches.
* Fixed the way IDF is calculated to account some extreme cases with small databases.
* New filter: `relevanssi_index_custom_fields` gives added control over which custom fields are indexed.
* Fixed filter: `relevanssi_pre_excerpt_content` wasn't working properly.
* Relevanssi now supports tax_query, for most part. You can query multiple taxonomies, use relation AND and OR, use operators AND, IN and NOT IN and choose include_children (which defaults to true). Old `taxonomy` and `term` still work, but I recommend using tax_query for the level of control it offers.
* Relevanssi now works better with category restrictions. The extra `cats` query variable is no longer necessary, Relevanssi can now read multiple categories from `cat`. You can also use `category__and`, `category__in` and `category__not_in`.
* Same goes with tags: `tags` is now longer necessary. Relevanssi has full support for `tag`, `tag_id`, `tag__and`, `tag__in`, `tag__not_in`, `tag_slug__and`, `tag_slug__in` and `tag_slug__not_in`. For `tag`, both `term1+term2` and `term1,term2` is supported.
* Relevanssi now supports `author_name` and negative values for `author`.
* Relevanssi now supports `offset` query variable.
* Relevanssi now supports meta_query. You can use all comparisons (also EXISTS and NOT EXISTS, even if you don't have WP 3.5). You can also use the older `meta_key` and `meta_value` query variables, including all the comparisons. I have not tested all possible meta_query constructions, so bug reports of things that don't work as expected are welcome.
* New index on the database makes some database operations faster.
* New filter: `relevanssi_user_add_data` lets you add extra data to user profiles before indexing them.
* Removed a bug that prevents one-character words from being indexed in titles, despite the minimum word length setting.
* Removed a warning when searching for nothing.
* Fixes a warning about $wpdb->prepare() caused by a change in WordPress 3.5.

= 1.9.2.1 =

= 1.9.1 =
* Fixed a major bug that caused the searches to fail when "Limit searches" was enabled, but "Limit" was not defined.
* Added "-es" to the list of suffixes stripped by the stemmer. If you use the stemmer, you need to reindex the database.
* Modified `relevanssi_remove_punct()` to replace curly apostrophes and quotes with spaces instead of removing them, to make the index more consistent (regular apostrophes were replaced with spaces). Reindexing the database is a good idea.
* Fixed some misleading text on the options page.

= 1.9 =
* The default function on `relevanssi_post_ok` filter is now set to priority 9, instead of 10, so that user functions happen after the default function by default.

* Fixed warnings for undefined variables.
* Relevanssi won't prevent media library searches anymore.
* Search terms are no longer highlighted in titles on post pages. That caused too many problems.
* You can now choose to allow HTML tags in excerpts.

* Phrases are now also recognized in drafts and attachments.
* Fixed an error message caused by searching for numbers.
* You can now set `post_types` to 'any'.
* Role-Scoper users: in order to make Relevanssi work with Role-Scoper, replace the Relevanssi helper file in Role-Scoper with [this file](http://www.relevanssi.com/relevanssi-helper-front_rs.txt).
* Removed an error message about set_time_limit() under safe_mode.
* Fixed errors caused by / characters in highlighting.
* Added an alert when user hasn't selected any post types to index (and default values).
* Custom field setting 'visible' works now.
* Relevanssi won't mess media library searches any more.
* Search terms are no longer highlighted in titles on post pages. That caused too many problems.
* New filter: `relevanssi_didyoumean_query` let's you modify the query for Did you mean? queries
* New filter: `relevanssi_user_searches_capability` lets you modify the minimum capability required to see the User searches page.
* When filtering results with taxonomy=a|b&term=a|b syntax, you can now use more terms per taxonomy, like this: taxonomy=a|b&term=a,b|c,d.

= 1.8.2.1 =
* A small fix to make Role-Scoper integration work better.

= 1.8.2 =

* I improved the way Relevanssi and Role-Scoper work together.

= 1.8 =
* Searching for pages in admin didn't work properly. Fixed that.
* Searches where posts_per_page was set to -1 didn't work well. They should work now.
* New filter 'relevanssi_content_to_index' let's user add whatever content they wish to posts before they are indexed.
* The 'relevanssi_post_ok' hook didn't work well with multiple functions attached. It now has two parameters: first one is the $post_ok value to change and second is the post ID. Make sure you specify two parameters in add_filter() call.
* Fuzzy search didn't always activate when it should, if all found posts are private posts that can't be shown to user.
* The default punctuation remover will now replace apostrophes with spaces instead of removing them. To see this in effect, you need to reindex database.
* Relevanssi will now disable the default WordPress search when Relevanssi is running. (Thanks to John Blackbourn)
* You can now set the "Custom fields to index" to "all" to index all custom fields and "visible" to index all visible custom fields (but not the ones with names starting with an underscore).
* Auto-update should work better now.
* Tab characters in excerpts are handled better now.
* Relevanssi search logs will now store user ID's and IP addresses for each query.
* You can now use user logins as well as numeric ID's to stop user from being logged.

* New collation rules to MySQL databases will make sure that word pairs like "pode" and "pôde" will not be considered duplicates in the stopword database.
* Relevanssi will now automatically choose the correct stopword list based on WPLANG setting.
* Attachments are now handled better. I'd still like to hear any complaints about attachments.
* You can now use the minus operator for Boolean NOT. "dog -cat" will return all posts with the word "dog" but not the word "cat". This does not work combined with phrases.
* "Exclude post from index" metabox now appears on edit pages for all post types, not just post and page.
* Relevanssi now updates index for posts added with wp_update_post() function. (Thanks to Simon Blackbourn)

= 1.7.9 =
* A small optimization attempt broke searches in admin. Fixed that.

= 1.7.8 =
* Relevanssi indexed user profiles on update, whether the option was checked or not.
* Relevanssi tried to index taxonomy terms on update, but couldn't, because there was another bug that prevented it.
* In some cases stripping tags would cause words to be joined. Tags are now replaced with spaces to make sure that doesn't happen.
* Fixed problems with undefined variables.
* Sometimes text would have non-typical space characters left in it, causing trouble. Relevanssi can now remove those spaces.
* Relevanssi had some problems with WP-Footnotes plugin, fixed that.
* New filter 'relevanssi_modify_wp_query_filter' lets you modify $wp_query before it is passed to Relevanssi.

= 1.7.7 =
* Fixed a major bug that can make indexing fail when the user has manually chosen to hide posts from the index.
* Removed default values from text columns in the database.
* Relevanssi will now index pending and future posts. These posts are only shown in the admin search.
* Using multiple taxonomies in search will now use OR logic between term within the same taxonomy and AND logic between different taxonomies. Thanks to Jonathan Liuti.
* Added a shortcode `noindex` that can be used to prevent parts of posts being indexed. In order to use the shortcode, you must enable expanding shortcodes in indexing.

= 1.7.6 =
* New filter `relevanssi_results` added. This filter will process an array with (post->ID => document weight) pairs.
* Fixed a mistake in the FAQ: correct post date parameter is `post_date`, not `date`.
* When continuing indexing, Relevanssi now tells if there's more to index. (Thanks to mrose17.)
* Private and draft posts were deleted from the index when they were edited. This bug has been fixed. (Thanks to comprock.)
* Improved WPML support.
* The `relevanssi_index_doc()` function has a new parameter that allows you to bypass global $post and force the function to index the document given as a parameter (see 1.7.6 release notes at Relevanssi.com for more details).

= 1.7.5 =
* Drafts are now indexed and shown in the admin search.
* A first test version of English stemmer (or suffix stripper) is available. Enable it with `add_filter('relevanssi_stemmer', 'relevanssi_simple_english_stemmer');`.

* Fixed a bug related that caused AND queries containing short search terms to fall back to OR searches.
* The 'relevanssi_match' filter now gets the IDF as an additional parameter to make recalculating weight easier.
* Added a very nice related searches feature by John Blackbourn.

= 1.7.3 =

* Added support for 'author' query variable.
* Added support for searches without a search term.

= 1.7.2 =
* Fixed another bug that was causing error notices.

= 1.7.1 =

= 1.7 =
* Relevanssi now stores more data about custom fields and custom taxonomies, allowing more fine-tuned control of results.
* There was a bug in custom field indexing that caused all custom field terms get a term frequency of 1.
* There was a bug in custom taxonomy indexing, effects of which are uncertain. Probably nothing major.
* The 'tag' (and 'tags') query variable now accepts tag names as well as tag IDs. For category names, you can use 'category_name'.
* Relevanssi can now index user-specified MySQL columns from the wp_posts table.
* It's now possible to adjust weights for all taxonomies, not just categories and tags.
* It's now possible to give a weight bonus for recent posts.

= 1.6.2.1 =
* Fixed a nasty bug that prevented indexing the database. If you installed 1.6.2 and ran into the problem, update and check the correct post types to index.

= 1.6.2 =
* Somebody had problems with the log table ID field going over MEDIUMINT limit. I changed the ID field to BIGINT.
* There were serious problems with custom post type names that include 'e_' in them. That's now fixed.

= 1.6.1 =
* Fixed small bugs in the Did you mean -feature. (Thanks to John Blackbourn.)
* Fixed the tf*idf weighing a bit in order to increase the effect of the idf component. This should improve results of OR searches in particular by giving more weight to rarer terms.
* Fixed the WPML filter when working with multisite environment. (Thanks to Richard Vencu.)
* Fixed (for real) a bug that created bad suggestion URLs with WPML. (Thanks to John Blackbourn.)

* Better way to choose which post types are indexed.
* Post meta fields that contain arrays are now indexed properly, expanding all the arrays.

= 1.5.12.beta =
* If a custom field limitation is set and no matches are found, no results are returned.
* New filter `relevanssi_fuzzy_query`. This can be used to change the way fuzzy matches are made.
* There's a meta box on post and page edit pages that you can use to exclude posts and pages from search.

* OR fallback search had a bug. Fixed that.
* Custom field searches support phrases. Thanks to davidn.de.
* Fixed a bug that caused problems when paging search results.
* `get_the_excerpt` filters weren't triggered on excerpt creation. `the_excerpt` is not used, as it will add unnecessary HTML code to the excerpts.

= 1.5.11.beta =
* New filter `relevanssi_do_not_index`. Filter is passed a post id and if it returns `true`, the post will not be indexed.
* New query variable: use `tag` or `tags` to filter results by tag. Both take comma-separated lists of tag ids (not tag slugs or names) and filter results by them (it's an OR, not AND operation).

* Relevanssi-created excerpts are now passed through `the_excerpt` and `get_the_excerpt` filters.
* Attachments (with post status inherit) couldn't be found in search. Now they can.

= 1.5.10.beta =
* Removed some unnecessary filter calls.
* the_content filters didn't have any effect on excerpts, now they work as they should.
* Taxonomy term search didn't work properly.
* I've moved the "strip invisibles" function after shortcode expansion in indexing and excerpt creation, so objects, embeds and styles created by shortcodes are stripped. Let me know if this causes any problems.
* Multibyte string functions are not required anymore, Relevanssi will work without, but will cause problems if you try to handle multibyte strings without multibyte functions. (Thanks to John Blackbourn.)
* Couple of functions Relevanssi uses weren't namespaced properly. They are now. (Thanks to John Blackbourn.)
* When $post is being indexed, `$post->indexing_content` is set to `true`. This can be useful for plugin developers and all sorts of custom hacks. (Thanks to John Blackbourn.)
* User search log now displays the total number of searches. (Thanks to Simon Blackbourn.)
* Database now has an index on document ID, which should make indexing faster.
* If you upgrade from 1.5.8 or earlier, emptying the database manually is not necessary.
* The plugin can now be upgraded automatically. The required API key can be found on Relevanssi.com in the sidebar after you log in.

= 1.5.9 =
* Fixed a MySQL error that was triggered by a media upload.
* Minimum word length to index wasn't enforced properly.
* Fixed a bug that caused an error when quick editing a post.
* Improved the handling of punctuation.
* Added an indexing option to manage thousands separators and large numbers better.
* The database is changed. The change requires reindexing and emptying the database before activating the plugin. Either truncate the database from phpMyAdmin or similar tool or use the "Delete plugin options" (but remember to back up your options and stopwords first!).
* Adjusted the default throttle to 300 posts from 500 posts.

= 1.5.8 =
* Added a new hook `relevanssi_excerpt_content`; see [Knowledge Base](http://www.relevanssi.com/category/knowledge-base/) for details.
* Improved the indexing procedure to prevent MySQL errors from appearing and to streamline the process.

= 1.5.7 =
* 1.5.6 was broken, this is a quick fix release.

= 1.5.6 =
* Added default values to the database columns, this could cause some problems.
* Indexing could cause problems, because Relevanssi changed the contents of global $post. That's fixed now.
* There's an option to choose the default order of search results, by relevance or by date.
* Indexing settings have a new option to only index certain post types.

= 1.5.5 =
* Added two new filters: `relevanssi_index_titles` and `relevanssi_index_content`. Add a function that returns `false` to the filters to disable indexing titles and post content respectively.
* Google Adsense caused double hits to the user search logs. That's now fixed thanks to Justin Klein.

= 1.5.4 =
* It's now possible to remove matches from the results with the external filter `relevanssi_match`. If the weight is set to 0, the match will be removed.
* Multisite installations had problems - installing plugin on a single site in network didn't work. John Blackbourn found and fixed the bug, thanks!

= 1.5.3 =
* User search log is available to user with `edit_post` capabilities (editor role). There's also an option to remove Relevanssi branding from the user search logs. Thanks to John Blackbourn.
* A proper database collation is now set. Thanks to John Blackbourn.
* UI looks better. Thanks to John Blackbourn.
* Small fixes: spelling corrector uses now correct multibyte string operators, unnecessary taxonomy queries are prevented. Thanks to John Blackbourn.
* You can now export and import settings. Thanks to ThreeWP Ajax Search for showing me a good (easy) way to do this.

= 1.5.2 =
* A German translation is included, thanks to David Decker.
* A get_term() call was missing a second parameter and throwing errors occasionally. Fixed that.
* Fixed a bug that caused Cyrillic searches in the log to get corrupted.
* Punctuation removal filter was actually missing from the code. Oops. Fixed that now.

= 1.5.1 =
* The result caching system didn't work properly. It works now.
* Limiting results with custom field key and value didn't work properly: it matched the value to the whole field. Now it matches the value to any part of the custom field. That should make more sense.

= 1.5 =
* Taxonomy pages (tags, categories, custom taxonomies) can now be indexed and searched.
* Short search terms don't crash the search anymore.
* There are fixes to the user search as well, including a new option to index additional fields.
* Relevanssi now uses search result caching system that greatly reduces the number of database calls made.
* Punctuation removal function is now triggered with a filter call and can thus be replaced.

= 1.4.5 =
* New filter: `relevanssi_match` allows you to weight search results.
* Similar to `cats` vs `cat`, you can now use `post_types` to restrict the search to multiple post types.
* Multisite search supports post type restriction.

= 1.4.4 =
* Changed the way search results are paginated. This makes adjusting the number of search results shown much easier.

= 1.4.3 =
* Fixed the Did you mean -feature.
* WordPress didn't support searching for multiple categories with the `cat` query variable. There's now new `cats` which can take multiple categories.

= 1.4.2 =
* Multisite search had bugs. It's working now.
* Stopwords are not highlighted anymore. Now this feature actually works.

= 1.4.1 =
* Textdomain was incorrect.
* The new database structure broke the throttle and the spelling correction. These are now fixed.

= 1.4 =
* New database structure, which probably reduces the database size and makes clever stuff possible.
* The throttle option had no effect, throttle was always enabled. Now the option works. You can now also either replace the throttle function with your own (through 'relevanssi_query_filter') or modify it if necessary ('relevanssi_throttle').
* Highlights didn't work properly with non-ASCII alphabets. Now there's an option to make them work.
* Title highlight option now affects external search term highlights as well.
* Stopwords are not highlighted anymore.
* Fixed a small mistake that caused error notices.
* Custom post types, particularly those created by More Types plugin, were causing problems.

= 1.3.2 =
* Expired cache data is now automatically removed from the database every day. There's also an option to clear the caches.
* A nasty database bug has been fixed (thanks to John Blackbourn for spotting this).
* Fixed bugs on option page.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed the multiple taxonomy search logic to AND instead of OR.

* It's now possible to use more than one taxonomy at the same time.

= 1.2 =
* Relevanssi can now highlight search terms from incoming queries.
* Spelling correction in Did you mean searches didn't work.
* Some shortcode plugins (Catablog, for example) were having trouble; fixed that.

= 1.1.2 =
* The plugin didn't update databases correctly, causing problems.

= 1.1.1 =
* Very small fix that improves plugin compatibility with Relevanssi when using shortcodes.

= 1.1 =
* Multisite WordPress support. See FAQ for instructions on how to search multiple blogs.
* Improved the fallback to fuzzy search if no hits are found with regular search.
* AND searches sometimes failed to work properly, causing unnecessary fallback to OR search. Fixed.
* When using WPML, it's now possible to choose if the searches are limited to current language.
* Adding stopwords from the list of 25 common words didn't work. It works now.
* The instructions to add a category dropdown to search form weren't quite correct. They are now.
