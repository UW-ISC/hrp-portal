== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= About Plugin Support? =

Post your question on support forum and we will try to answer your question as quick as possible.

= Why did you make this plugin?  =

We couldn't find a plugin that would export all URLs, titles and categories in a simplest possible way. So, we decided to take step further to fill this gap.

= Why the file name is randomly generated?  =

Exporting the file with static name can be easily found by malicious attacker, and may result in sensitive information leakage. So we decided to generate random name, which is harder to guess. However plugin provides complete control over file name.

= Can I delete generated CSV file?  =

Yes, absolutely. It is highly recommended, once the file is generated, there is a direct link to delete the generated file.

= Does Export All URLs make changes to the database? =

No. It has no settings/configurations to store so it does not touch the database.

= How can I check out if the plugin works for me? =

Install and activate. Go to Tools / Export All URLs. Select all options and download CSV file.

= Which PHP version do I need? =

This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.4 and greater. WordPress itself [recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). If you're using a PHP version lower than 5.4 please upgrade your PHP version or contact your Server administrator.

= Are there any known incompatibilities? =

Nope, there were some issues in past, but they were fixed in version 4.0.

= Are there any server requirements? =

Yes. The plugin requires a PHP version 5.4 or higher and Wordpress version 3.1.0 or higher.
