<?php
/**
 * Search results are contained within a div.searchwp-live-search-results
 * which you can style accordingly as you would any other element on your site
 *
 * Some base styles are output in wp_footer that do nothing but position the
 * results container and apply a default transition, you can disable that by
 * adding the following to your theme's functions.php:
 *
 * add_filter( 'searchwp_live_search_base_styles', '__return_false' );
 *
 * There is a separate stylesheet that is also enqueued that applies the default
 * results theme (the visual styles) but you can disable that too by adding
 * the following to your theme's functions.php:
 *
 * wp_dequeue_style( 'searchwp-live-search' );
 *
 * You can use ~/searchwp-live-search/assets/styles/style.css as a guide to customize
